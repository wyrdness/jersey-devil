Described as having the head of a horse or goat, bat-like wings, hooves, and a forked tail, the creature has been part of New Jersey folklore for nearly three centuries. According to legend, it was born in 1735 as the cursed thirteenth child of Mother Leeds. The creature gained widespread notoriety during a mass sighting wave in January 1909, when thousands of people across New Jersey and Pennsylvania reported encounters. The Jersey Devil remains deeply embedded in New Jersey culture and is considered the state's most famous legend."
