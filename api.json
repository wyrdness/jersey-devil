      "full": "The Jersey Devil is a legendary creature said to inhabit the Pine Barrens of South Jersey. Described as having the head of a horse or goat, bat-like wings, hooves, and a forked tail, the creature has been part of New Jersey folklore for nearly three centuries. According to legend, it was born in 1735 as the cursed thirteenth child of Mother Leeds. The creature gained widespread notoriety during a mass sighting wave in January 1909, when thousands of people across New Jersey and Pennsylvania reported encounters over the span of one intense week. The Jersey Devil remains deeply embedded in New Jersey culture and is considered one of America's oldest and most enduring regional cryptids. It serves as the state's unofficial mascot, a tourism draw, and the namesake of New Jersey's NHL team."
