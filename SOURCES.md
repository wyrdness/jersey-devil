## Notes on Sources

### Reliability Assessment

**High Reliability**:
- Contemporary 1909 newspaper accounts (primary sources, though sensationalistic)
- Academic publications from university presses
- Historical archives and documents

**Medium Reliability**:
- McCloy & Miller (1976) - Well-researched but some folklore mixed with history
- Oral tradition accounts - Valuable cultural data but often embellished
- Regional folklore collections - Important cultural information, historical accuracy varies

**Low Reliability**:
- Tabloid coverage
- Unverified online accounts
- Some popular books with poor source documentation
- Anecdotal reports without corroboration

### Important Considerations

Many Jersey Devil sources blend folklore, legend, and historical fact. Critical analysis is essential. The 1909 newspaper accounts are valuable primary sources but were written during a newspaper circulation war and should be read with awareness of sensationalistic journalism practices of the era.

The political origins theory (Leeds-Franklin rivalry) is supported by historical evidence but the direct connection to the Jersey Devil legend involves scholarly inference.

Indigenous connections are speculative and should not be presented as established fact without clear documentation.
